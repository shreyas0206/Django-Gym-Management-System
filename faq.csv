1,What Is Zumba?,"Zumba''s most well-known and popular program is its namesake class, Zumba. This dance class features high- and low-intensity intervals that help improve cardiovascular fitness while also enhancing balance, coordination, agility, and to some degree, strength through the application of beginner-accessible choreography."
2,How do I stay motivated?,"Regularly set goals for yourself to have something to work towards, challenge yourself and keep yourself accountable."
3,How much cardio should I be doing?,"The answer to many of the questions on this list, including this one, is “it depends.” I know. It’s frustrating to hear that answer, but I’ll break down WHY and hopefully this will help you determine the best method for your unique body.
With cardio, the amount you’re doing depends on a lot of different factors: your current activity level, your goals, and how hard you’re working. If you’re currently sedentary, general recommendations of around 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week (about 30 minutes most days of the day), would be way too much. In that case, you’d start with shorter rounds: 10-15 minutes each day of easy cardio (like walking) and build on from there."
4,How much weight should I be lifting when I strength train?,"When you choose a weight for strength training, pick a weight that’s “heavy for you.” For example, 5 lbs may be heavy for one person, while 50 lbs is heavy for someone else. This will depend on your current strength and fitness level.
You should be able to complete all reps in a set with good form, and have to push yourself to finish the last 1-2 reps of each set. If you could easily breeze through 15-20 reps of an exercise at your current weight, it’s a good sign to bump it up a little. On the other hand, if you’re struggling to complete all reps and compromising form, decrease the amount of weight or resistance you’re using."
5,How many times a week should I exercise?,"How long is a piece of string? This really depends on your preference. Ask yourself, how many days can you, and would like to, realistically and sustainably exercise?
Bear in mind other lifestyle factors – like spending time with family and friends or when you’re at work.
Doing it this way means you’ll be able to maintain your exercise routine for the long-term and you’ll see real results."
6,How long do I need to work out for?,"Your current fitness levels, the type of training and the intensity all play a part in how long to exercise for. In general, the more intense the session, the shorter it can be.

The NHS recommends 30-minutes of moderate physical activity five times a week to stay healthy."
7,How do I warm-up and cool-down when I exercise?,"The goal here is to slowly warm up the body to mobilise the muscle groups and joints you’ll be using during your workout.

This can be done through some light movement, such as walking, skipping or a gentle jog.

The key is to keep things moving and your heart rate up, so your body is feeling prepped to workout.

For the cool down, you want to look to slow down your heart rate by completing slower cardio movement and static stretches that work on the muscle groups you’ve used during your session.

These could be hamstring stretches, chest stretches against a wall and kneeling lunges to target hip flexors."
8,How do I stay motivated?,"Making your exercise routine manageable for your given level is crucial, otherwise there will be more push back mentally when it comes to getting moving.

Mentally you’ll find it easier to tackle a 10-minute walk around the block rather than a marathon.

Pick something you can manage moving forwards.

Asking yourself why you want to exercise is something we don’t often do but is an effective way to maintain motivation long term.

Whether it be wanting to feel more confident in their body or be fit and healthy enough to play with their kids for longer."
9,What to eat before and after a workout?,"Firstly, make sure that you ate your last large meal 2-3 hours before your workout. Otherwise, you can feel uncomfortable whilst training

Consuming some simple carbohydrates about an hour prior to working out is a great habit to get into – think fresh or dried fruit, some granola, or a cereal bar. This will provide you with some readily available energy during your session.

Post workout, you need to re-build and refuel. Slower releasing carbohydrates to replenish any lost muscle glycogen – or glucose – along with protein helps kickstart the muscle rebuilding process

Foods such as brown pasta, brown rice and potatoes for your carbohydrates, and meats such as fish or chicken and beans, and pulses for your protein."
